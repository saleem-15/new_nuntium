## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

This project is more than just a news app; it represents a personal journey of **professional revival** and **skill sharpening** after a two-year hiatus from Flutter development due to difficult circumstances.

The main goals of this project are:

- **Mastering Modern Standards:** Implementing the latest Flutter and Dart 3.x features.
- **Clean Architecture:** Applying a "Feature-First" layered structure for better scalability.
- **State Management:** Refreshing my expertise in GetX and reactive programming.
- **Professional Workflow:** Adhering to professional Git conventions, clean code principles, and efficient development tools.

It serves as a live testament to resilience, continuous learning, and the pursuit of excellence in software engineering.
